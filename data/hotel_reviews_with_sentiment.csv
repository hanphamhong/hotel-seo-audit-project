New York Marriott Downtown,5/5/25 20:15,40403,"decent hotel in downtown manhattan with good rooms but with an exorbitant fee ($52/night).

the check-in was a disaster, the person who attended us did not understand absolutely anything (between the mask and the fact that he spoke super fast), to give you an idea, we did not even know the room number. gentlemen of the hotel, we tourists adapt and try to understand their language but you working in the tourist sector must keep in mind that you are dealing with people who do not speak your same language and even adapting to ours is part of your profession.

W New York - Times Square,4/20/25 12:26,68315,"husband & i did a 24hr staycation in the city. location is great! we did overnight self park at their suggested spot with no issues. valet is just double the price.

i do like how the elevator to the lobby is separate from the elevators that goes from the lobby to the rooms. staff are friendly. living room bar is nice. esthetically nice esp with those cozy nooks.

king bed city view room - we weren’t given a high floor but the view wasn’t bad. just wasn’t great. did wish we got a higher floor. the carpets were outdated, certain decor was peeling, bathroom metal vanity was quite rusted so we didn’t use the towels that were touching that metal vanity, but other than that, it was fine. i have pretty bad allergies so i noticed all the piled dust on tv, lighting features, bed frame and that little bed ledge that’s long enough to place your luggage. it’s not terrible but cleaning was bare minimum in my opinion.

noise from 19th floor - not too terrible. it’s alright but it’s time sq. what do you expect. it’s not noisy to the point that you can’t sleep and i’m a light sleeper, however, i was out until 4am so i ko pretty hard once it was time to sleep for a few hrs. housekeeping was very, very loud starting 9am. they basically were my alarm clock lol

nearby - we didn’t eat at the either two restaurants below the hotel bc we went somewhere else. blue fish seemed a bit busier than dos caminos but again, we didn’t eat there. there was a cvs not too far should you need stuff quickly.

during checkout, my husband was handling it, which i should’ve double checked. but by the time we left, i saw we were charged a gatorade, which we did purchase, but also a johnny walker, which we did not drink. we noticed there was only one johnny walker there but we assumed they were just out of one and forgot to restock. don’t feel like driving back nor dealing with an issue over the phone for that charge. just taking a loss for it, but next time, i will be taking a picture of the mini fridge, which i feel like i shouldn’t have to do, but just covering my grounds at least.

will i be staying here in the future? possibly and only if i can get a higher floor. it’s more of a last minute fall back if anything.",5.0,3.0,,3,,,Marriott,0.054,0.829,0.117,0.9799

"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",6/4/25 8:42,11421,"i'd not recommend staying here unless you plan to sleep after 4 am.

the hotel has two towers; one tower is taller and has a club on the 12th floor. the club operates until 4 am everyday except monday and tuesday (unless they have private events). the bass can be felt on the 9th floor. i have my ear plugs and a white noise but i still cannot sleep. the bed vibrate and i can hear all the beats.

the room is pretty interesting, but i'd say they are very gimmicky and very annoying instead of being nice. the light controls are laid out in a way that you need a diagram to operate. and the buttons do not dim at night. the noise isolation between rooms is bad and on par with other ny hyatt hotels. for example, you can hear all the doors slamming every morning, as usual.

although the room looks old, in my opinion, it feels cleaner than other hyatt i stayed at in ny. so i guess that's a plus.

the bathroom is spacious for a ny hotel room and the water pressure is generous. although the toilet is a bit too tall for my liking and it does not soft close.

adequate amount of elevators.

the location is nice but it's not a redeeming quality due to the excessive noise from the club.

in short, avoid this hotel unless you are here to party until 4 am.",4.0,1.0,3.0,1,,,Hyatt,0.077,0.819,0.104,0.8558
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",6/3/25 15:33,30857,"i would rate negative zero stars if i could. i can see why their rating has dropped to 3.9 stars from 4.8..

so many issues i’m unsure where to begin, we checked out early as the staff was so rude and unpleasant and made the end of our stay unpleasant. then they had the audacity to charge me thousands of dollars extra even though we did not break any policies.

there were damages in the room prior to us occupying it which we do have video reference of. there were also no hot water in two sinks…. in the 4500 per night king guest suite!

we were also falsely accused of smoking in the room, which we did not.. as well as leaving trash in the room… as the garbage was left by the door for housekeeping to collect. we requested house keeping prior to departure and we were not accommodated.

there were absolutely no broken items left by our behalf, and we were falsely accused and charged for that too with no evidence provided.

i requested a copy of the bill and also asked them provide evidentiary support of what they charged us for, showing the dates and details for my records, as i need my legal advisor to review at this point, as they refused to adjust my bill or even provide me with a formal copy.

and please note their establishment has become anything but high-quality, and i wouldn’t want to stay at dream downtown again after the awful experience we had. we had to check out more than two days early because the staff made our stay so uncomfortable and it was an extreme inconvenience. my niece also flew back to north carolina early due to the unpleasant stay. this was for my sisters birthday and a networking event for a major artist i couldn’t event have there due to non working speakers and a less than accommodating staff.. which i had to book elsewhere last minute - and almost lost my job over it.

the only person on their staff who was so pleasant and made our stay comfortable and was always accommodating was latrell (front desk). he was very sincere and accommodating and reflects how a hospitality specialist should be and treat customers. shout out to latrell!!!!!

as mentioned in my original complaint inquiry, i had to book a suite at a an actual high-quality hotel for a major artist networking conference event last minute due to their “engineer” not being able to fix the ceiling speakers. absolutely absurd.

we were also accused of playing loud music by security, and didn’t even have working speakers at the time to have done so……

we spent about 20 grand in their establishment over the weeks we were there and did not break any of their policies and this is an extremely horrible way to treat customers.

huge thanks to the entire team for their great service. we’ll definitely be back!

we love staying at the dream hotel because it’s in the perfect location—right in chelsea, in the heart of the meatpacking district, where there’s always so much to do.
there are amazing bars for nightlife, stunning rooftops, and the hotel itself has a pool and a very cool poolside area—perfect for relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere.

the service was excellent, the cocktails were really well made, and the energy of the place just feels special.

on top of that, the location is super convenient: just one block from chelsea market, and one or two blocks from several top-notch restaurants where you can enjoy a refined dinner. these are trendy, high-quality spots that are really worth visiting.

the neighborhood feels very safe and walkable, even at night.

check-in day was awful. the first person said i had to wait for a manager. i waited thinking they would find the manager for me, but instead i had to go back to the front desk and wait in line again. the service at the desk has to be the worst people i have ever dealt with at a ny hotel at this price point. also, i was told late checkout was not available even for globalists

we checked multiple times for slippers until they finally called to inform us they were “out of slippers”

the hotel hosts a rooftop bar but they are not associated with the property. there are no perks for the guests who stay here. the first night wasn’t even busy, but they wanted $300 min spend. the second night it was closed for a private party. next door is tao and several other nice establishments.

the only nice thing to say about this place is the location is pretty convenient. there are plenty of bars and food options nearby.

the suite is misrepresented on the website, as there is only one king bed and one murphy bed. the espresso machine was dirty. the private terrace hot tub made it worth it. but still, i cannot recommend this place in its current state. also, the tv barely worked. no other amenities. dollar store soap. the blinds were broken. the tablet doesn’t work. the couch has “stains”",4.0,3.0,1.0,2,,,Hyatt,0.085,0.846,0.069,-0.7225

one major issue: do not touch the complimentary water bottles in the room. there was a note saying they would be charged at $6 each unless you're a world of hyatt member—in which case they're free. i am a member, and yet i was still charged $18. to make matters worse, there's an additional $89 charge on my credit card that i still haven’t received an explanation for. it’s currently being investigated.

breakfast was decent, but getting to it was an ordeal. first, there’s the wait for the elevator—an average of 30 minutes just to get one with enough space to enter safely. the alternative is taking the stairs. once you finally arrive at the canteen, it’s overcrowded and chaotic. you’ll likely have to stand and wait another 30 minutes just to find a free table.

the lobby is no better. it’s constantly packed, day and night, with loud music playing nonstop—far from ideal when you're trying to relax or wait for a transfer or taxi.

the combination of location, comfort of the facilities, attention and professionalism of the hotel staff, and quality and variety of the free breakfast buffet is excellent.

we booked a room on a high floor, and what a success! absolute tranquility, and spectacular views. for the price difference, it's totally worth it.

it is true that the rooms could be a little bigger, but we saw that it was the standard for the area, and they were very clean, modern and functional.

the double bed was very comfortable, and the sofa bed, enough for our daughter, although i doubt it would be suitable for an adult.

the bathroom was small, but the shower, perfect, with very good pressure, and we were on the 24th of 26th floor.

there were 4 elevators, and we never had to wait too long to take one. obviously, if you want to use it when the whole hotel goes down at the last minute for breakfast, things can change. the breakfast buffet time slots and their attendance are indicated on the lift doors themselves. common sense

the free buffet was plentiful and varied, with different choices of breads, coffee, tea, infusions and milk. various machine juice options. butters, jams, cream cheese, etc. you had options to make your breakfast as hearty as you like, with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, creilles, hard-boiled eggs, etc. but there were also healthier options, and they changed the fresh fruit option daily, with apples or bananas. and there was always melon, pineapple and grape fruit salad, as well as a bowl of red fruit and another bowl of natural yoghurt.

wow, you were never hungry. we had a good breakfast and went out to visit the city well fed!

the hotel is just a few streets away from many points of interest, such as madison square garden, high line park, vessel, little island, bryant park and the nyc public library, times square, the summit, rockefeller center and a long et cetera.

and it is close to the 42nd street bus station and metro stations. you couldn't be better connected. in a few stops you were in central park and its museums, or in the area of ​​dumbo, brooklyn, wall street.

finally, highlight the hotel staff. simply perfect. they were there for everything, took care of the details and were very kind. an 11 out of 10 for them.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5,,,Hyatt,0.027,0.805,0.168,0.9971

2. you hate privacy: a good majority of the rooms in this property are facing each other in the inner courtyard within very close proximity, but the windows don't have privacy tinting or have light filtering curtains. it is not uncommon to see other guests walking around in the nude in their rooms unaware that everyone else in the property can see them

3. you hate convenience: however designed this property should permanently retire from the hospitality business before wrecking more havoc. light switches? no, forget about that lets just add a bunch of fancy buttons with complicated instructions for turning off the lights. garbage cans in the room? nope that is too archaic for this property. a towel rack? no, let's just add a ladder shelf that isn't attached to the wall to hang the towels and have our guests get hit by this massive wooden rack that isn't anchored to any fixed structure. need to rinse your mouth after brushing your teeth? nope nevermind the bathroom faucet is in the middle of a large gaping pipe that will cause you to hit your head if you try to drink water.

booked two rooms at dream hotel downtown. tried to cancel less than two hours later — hotel refused. first they said they’d charge one night, then changed it to all three.

hotels can have policies, but in all my years of traveling, i’ve never seen a place treat customer service like a joke — and laugh while doing it.

they clearly hoped we’d cancel so they could resell the room and keep our money. when i showed up in person, the front desk manager played a smug game of “not my department.” hyatt’s own support confirmed they had the power to fix it — they just chose not to.

and if you do stay? good luck sleeping. there’s a nightclub on the 12th floor that makes your entire room shake. their solution? a note and a pair of foam earplugs.

it feels like a brothel for tao guests (nightclub next door on the first floor) disguised as a hotel more so than a hotel. it’s like the cosmopolitan meets motel 6. the halls and room decor are in rough shape, all the floors and furniture have been abused with no repair and refurbishment. marks everywhere, carpet in the room is super gross. ac is completely broken. fan putters for about 5 seconds then gives up when you try to turn it on. bed feels like a super bad, saggy sofa bed. shower has this super weird design choice chain mail curtain that is beyond modern edgy and into dungeon territory.

if you come here to check it off on the woh brand explorer like i did, just stay for one night and plan a late night out and early exit to minimize time actually spent at this place. my advice to hyatt is renovate it and actually care about the property or sell it and have another developer convert it into something else.

room was great, no concerns there. pleased to see smart tvs in the room which made streaming content easy. wi-fi was fast, no issues there. as other reviews mentionned, soundproofing isn't the best but didn't cause any problems.

they make it very clear that you pay a $45 fee per day - no issues with this - they offer a $30 food/dining credit along with this. my issue moreso stems with what i was able to get out this credit:

in-room minibar: many items were expired. noticed the diet coke had expired the week prior after drinking it and noticing that the taste was off. frustrating considering the steep 11$ price. there were also some cookies that expired in january 2025 (it is now the end of may 2025).

hotel bar: our first round of drinks was amazing - we really enjoyed. after ordering the same drink again, we were served the wrong drink. i sent that one back, and was again served the wrong drink. i tried one more time, sent that one back... i was again served the wrong drink. you cannot make this up.

InterContinental New York Barclay by IHG,5/12/25 13:00,39639,"we were in an emergency situation on saturday and had to check into this hotel in the middle of the night. i called the hotel ahead of time to see if they accepted cash for the room (and i'd pay the nightly deposit on a card). then person i spoke with said they did, in fact, accept cash. we arrive at the hotel around 2am. after about 30 minutes of the clerk ""finding us a room"".. he finds this fantastic option. decent price, too. after all that he informs me they don't accept cash. i then spent an hour finding an open atm lobby (most close overnight in nyc so nobody sleeps there). we get back, i pay and we move on from there. the room was pretty nice. we immediately find out the wifi is not working at all. i literally had three days of work ahead. i noticed very quickly that nearly all the staff lied to me. i kept asking and they said ""nobody has called with issues.. i'm sorry"". when the engineer shows up he tells me they've had ten calls about it. ten. this place hosts tons of corporate events etc. admitting to wifi issues means they'd have to refund a hefty amount of money to each individual person. during this fiasco, i dealt with two different women at the front desk who were absolutely terrific as far as customer service goes. they moved us to a better room in hopes of getting a slightly better wifi signal. while it didn't work, we were still super appreciative.

then to add insult to injury, i eat pringles from the mini bar, and they are as stale as you could imagine. absolutely disgusting. they tasted like they'd been there ten years. the fact that the entire mini bar was covered in dust should've told me.

now the reason i'm writing the review: today i need to extend one night. i go to the desk and i notice immediately an all male staff at the desk. the first guy i dealt with said they were sold out. he goes to get a manager and says ""well we can give you a room for $599"" mind you this is more than double the price. the employee was so disgustingly rude to me and spoke to me as if i was four years old. i immediately stopped him because, trust me, he would not want to hear what i have to say to him. i got the manager over. manager was worse. and here is the ultimate reason for the review: the manager, male, tells me : ""the room is double the price yes because we are pretty full.. if i let you have the room i have to put another guest somwhere else and that guest would've been paying $750 for your room"". so what is clear is this: they weren't sold out. they just were not concerned about taking care of me because they were price gauging the person who would be taking my room. i didn't even debate after that. i knew exactly what kind of place this was. they don't care about loyal customers... trust me. go to a better hotel like marriott or hilton. a place that shows value to someone staying longer term as opposed to a new customer paying more money. we found out this morning we'd need to stay another week. do the math. in exchange for one night of a higher rate, they lost out on a room being booked steadily for 7 more nights. the women that worked on saturday should be training every single person at that front desk including the sad excuse for a manager that is there today.",3.0,5.0,2.0,2,5/13/25 15:13,"AMJ, thank you for taking the time to share such a detailed account of your recent stay. Your feedback gives us important insights into your experience and highlights areas where we did not meet your expectations.

Navigating an emergency situation while traveling can make every detail feel even more critical, so encountering discrepancies in payment guidance on arrival is especially disappointing. The time you lost resolving your check-in and payment, especially in the middle of the night, is not the seamless arrival one should expect at a property that aims to open doors to a world of fascination and comfort. We apologize for the poor communication and the difficulties it caused you.

A modern traveler’s needs evolve quickly, and reliable connectivity is essential. We regret that your experience with the WiFi interrupted your ability to work and was compounded by unsatisfying, inconsistent updates from our team members. While our goal is always to handle concerns with transparency and genuine care, it is clear that our communication missed the mark. Please know that the insights you provided – including the discrepancy in information about ongoing connectivity challenges – will help us sharpen our intuitive approach, ensuring team members communicate more openly and helpfully with all guests moving forward.

Your recognition of the two colleagues at the front desk who responded thoughtfully and offered solutions by moving you to another room is sincerely appreciated. We will be sure to celebrate their efforts internally, as their approach reflects the warmth and care we strive to embody every day.

Discovering that your in-room refreshment was not as expected – and that its presentation did not meet the high standards cultivated by InterContinental’s global experience – detracted from the sense of comfort and care we aim to provide. We will use your observations to review the replenishment and quality assurance routines for our in-room offerings, aiming to delight guests with every detail, from the lighting and ambiance to even the simplest snack.

Regarding your efforts to extend your stay, we apologize that our communication about availability and rates gave you the impression of being undervalued as a returning guest. Our aim is always to strike a harmonious balance between providing freedom of choice and delivering familiar, consistent service. The interaction you described at the front desk does not reflect our brand proposition to be thoughtful, welcoming, or respectful. Your suggestion to use the positive example set by our colleagues earlier in your stay is well taken and will be addressed in our ongoing training, as we seek to inspire every team member to create Incredible Occasions for each guest.

Travel opens minds and connects cultures. We are dedicated to being a trusted partner for guests navigating both planned and unexpected journeys.

Your detailed thoughts on breakfast are valuable as well. Our team aims to set the tone for the day with intuitive, seamless service and clear communication about offerings—especially when it comes to personal touches, from your favorite egg preparation to a morning coffee. It is disappointing to learn that consistency was lacking and clarity about the beverage options fell short. Enjoying breakfast, whether lingering over a cappuccino or exchanging greetings with a colleague, should always be an uplifting, leisurely experience—never a source of confusion or stress.

Your observations highlight what InterContinental seeks to offer—thoughtful environments that invite you to connect, explore, and relax, all at the center of a world of culture and excitement. The team is delighted that these elements resonated with you and enriched your journey.

Your recognition of the hotel's dedication to cleanliness and ongoing maintenance is greatly valued.

It is rewarding to know that you discovered this attention to detail throughout your stay.

Regarding your arrival, the intention behind directing guests to the ambassador desk is to provide attentive, personalized service inspired by a pioneering spirit. The wait you experienced was certainly not how the arrival journey should feel, especially after a long journey. The hotel aims to strike a harmonious balance between attentive service and the freedom guests desire, and your feedback guides our quest to refine this interaction for future guests.

The amenity fee, as you noted, helps open doors to added experiences and includes dining credit to savor in the restaurant, allowing for more enjoyable culinary exploration.

"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",4/13/25 20:05,53098,"i stayed at the dream hotel last week for two nights with my 14 year old son. we were headed to a business trip in new jersey over his spring break and i wanted to show him around new york for a few days.

i loved the location of the dream hotel, but this being new york and it being a chain hotel i just wasn't expecting a lot in the way of over the top service (no offense to ny'ers, please!).

i have to say, i was totally blown away by the level of service. it felt like i was at a family owned hotel in a small town or the mountains or something. everyone was so incredibly nice to me - i couldn't believe it. a few people in particular stood out.

first was the general manager, sean. we didn't even know he was the gm when he started talking with us while we were waiting for the front desk. he was so friendly - asking us about our stay and where we were from and then connecting with us. he asked us what kind of food we were looking for and had so many great recommendation for pizza, donuts and even where to go for the best milkshake (my son's favorite thing to have!) just the way he took his time with us and spoke so kindly to my son really made us feel so welcome and like we were part of a family. i really can't recall being treated so kindly at any hotel and it was totally unexpected.

another person who stood out to me was oeteka. she had been working the night shift when we saw her at night and then we saw her again the next morning. i would have expected her to be so tired and just ready to go home, but she was instead incredibly friendly. she kept talking to my son, asking him what he was doing and how he was liking ny and offering friendly suggestions. i asked her how she could have so much positive energy after such a long overnight shift and she said ""i just really love my job!"". honestly hyatt is so incredibly lucky to have someone with such a great attitude.

thank you sean and oeteka for such a great stay and all the warmth you showed me and my son! it honestly felt like both of you were owners of the hotel with the pride you took in your work - it was totally unexpected and it really blew me away.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5,,,Hyatt,0.014,0.743,0.243,0.9991

Warwick New York,5/28/25 15:50,89724,"i booked a one bedroom suite for three nights and here is a list of the pros and cons that i observed. i was in the warwick suite on the 33rd floor.
pros:
1. great location! this hotel allows you an easy walk to central park, rockefeller center, 5th avenue for shopping and broadway plays.
2. staff was very friendly. everyone we encountered was extremely nice
3. good restaurant in the hotel. it is only open for breakfast and is a bit on the expensive side....but the food was very good.
4. very good room pricing
5. very large rooms for nyc
6. clean rooms
7. no observed bugs
cons:
1. very noisy. no, not from the street but from the hvac system (at least i think that is what the noise was coming from). there was a constant noise day and night. made sleeping a challenge.
2. very low water pressure
3. tiny elevators (6 people max) that were very slow and only two of the three elevators went to our floor.
4. in 1965 and 1966, the beatles stayed at the warwick....no that's not a negative. the negative is that based on our suite, the furniture is still the same stuff from the band's visit. in other words...the furniture, lamps, and paint on the walls are all very old and desperately in need of a refresh! the furniture was all scratched, paint coming off, and looked like it was literally 50 - 60 years old! i sat on the sofa in the living room and felt like there was no support at all. i was afraid that i was going to end up sinking to the floor (and i am truly not a heavy person).

i posted a few photos to illustrate my point. the first and second show the chipped and damaged furniture and the third shows the chips in the paint on the walls.

in summary, this place needs some tlc...and soon!

i'm truly sorry to have to give this hotel so many negatives...the people are very nice and, as i indicated, its in a truly excellent location, but it is incredibly run down. invest in some new furniture, carpeting and paint and this place would be amazing!",5.0,3.0,4.0,3,,,Warwick,0.062,0.804,0.134,0.9835

we stayed about 1.5 hours in the check-in line without any reason. when i complaint to manager (rodi) and asked for remedy i was told that since i booked via third party (orbitz, bookings.com, etc) so they can’t do anything to compensate me for my lost time of 1.5 hours (normal check in time: 4.00 pm). we were up since 5 am in order to catch up an out of state flight and would like to take some rest before we explore the down town but this late checked utterly failed our plan. on top of it we were surprised to see that a wrong room was provided to us. it was not the type of room we reserved about 3 weeks ago. we reserved the times square view room so when i made the complaint then the same manager rodi said that the hotel can’t guarantee a specific type of room. we paid a premium price of about extra $100/day and couldn’t get it – big cheat. this different room made our whole trip crumbled as my wife wasn’t happy with me who made this reservation. we could have gotten a better deal in the less price elsewhere if we need to take the room without view.

additionally, their customer service sucks, beds were miserable, no microwave, no lock in the bathroom door and no room service for the second day. we paid more than $550/day and got this type of lousy service. also, the hotel had refused to pay back the premium price (about $200) for that view. i would not recommend to anyone to stay there and ruin their ny trip. totally a rip-off and cheat.",2.0,1.0,1.0,1,5/4/25 22:48,"Zubair, the experience described is certainly not the seamless visit that is aimed to be provided.

Warwick New York,5/4/25 11:31,21586,"if i have to ""warn"" folks about this hotel, please do not ever reserve a room with them because i have the displeasure of requesting reversal of charges made to my credit card.

background info, when i made reservation for april 26, 2025 to april 29, 2025 on january 27, 2025, it clearly states on my confirmation that the hotel's cancellation policy is free cancellation and changeable up to 11:59 pm hotel local time, 1 day prior to arrival. with this in mind, i have up to april 25, 2025 11:59 pm (ok, i'll give the hotel benefit of doubt this could be interpreted as april 24, 2025 11:59 pm) to cancel my reservation.

on april 12, 2025 (or april 13, 2025), i used the hotel's system to cancel my reservation. my mistake was probably not to speak to a live person but with today's technology, i figured that i could cancel said reservation on my own, without hotel staff assistance. i checked several times if my reservation was cancelled and after several confirmation, i was assured the cancellation went through.

on april 29, 2025, i was looking at my credit card charges and i spotted a charge of $502.67 from warwick new york hotel. i immediately sent the hotel all the supporting documentation that the cancellation was made all within the time frame of the hotel's cancellation policy. on may 1, 2025, i received an email stating that my inquiry has been forwarded to front desk director for review. i have not heard from the hotel since then nor has there been an attempt to reverse the charges made by this hotel to my credit card.

i have to say that i am very displeased with warwick new york hotel for first, not honoring their own hotel cancellation policy, second for charging my credit card (and not checking their system for my cancellation since i was a no-show), and third for treating me like i don't matter.

if i could give this hotel a 0, i would. please don't ever make a reservation with this hotel because they don't honor their own cancellation policy if you have to cancel.",,,,1,,,Warwick,0.086,0.832,0.082,0.3725

Warwick New York,4/27/25 16:42,28686,"my family and i just spent nearly a week at this hotel and i want to break down each part of this awesome experience.
1. facilities / premises: this beautiful historic hotel has old world charm with current updates and technological resources without losing its original character. when you first walk in the lobby is absolutely beautiful. other reviews have complained about the lobby being small, but this hotel is about 100 years old, super large lobbies weren't so popular back then. the premises were clean, neat and well decorated with a lot of history and interesting back stories. i stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was incredibly beautiful. the suite was spacious, clean, and just very pretty. the furniture was comfortable and very nice and there was a lot of closet and storage space. the beds were roomy and very comfortable. we all had amazing restful nights during our visit. the bathroom was full of beautiful warm toned marble throughout. the tub / shower was spacious, the mirror was large, and the toilet and sink were always cleaned by the staff every morning. there were plenty of outlets and charging stations throughout the suite so we didn't have to jumble so many charging cords and plugs in one unit. the dorm sized refrigerator was surprisingly spacious and well hidden in the entertainment center. although there were a lot of updates to accommodate today's needs and technology, the warwick never lost it's historic charm and character which i enjoyed a lot. there are a few elevators, and they are small, so expect to bypass a few rides on move out days because more than likely the elevators will be full (which is expected), but it was never a very long wait, and we were never in a rush.

there is a gym and i was pleasantly surprised at just how roomy it was. it has the basic (very updated) workout equipment but there were a lot of clean towels readily available and there was enough space in between the equipment so you wouldn't bump into an exercising neighbor.

2. service / staff: i cannot say enough about the staff and the service. one evening we were walking back into the hotel from being out all day, and the first thing a staff member said to us was ""welcome back home,"" and that is what it really felt like, a home away from home. everyone was professional, accommodating, helpful, kind, and it really seemed like everyone enjoyed their jobs. i felt so spoiled during my short stay and it was amazing. anything we needed, the staff accommodated for us and if it was something the hotel did not have, they did their best to try to get it for us. it was really just an awesome experience. the cleaning staff was quick, efficient, accommodating, and patient (especially when we weren't ready for the room to be cleaned). also, the front desk staff was knowledgeable about the city and the sites to visit and places to enjoy. it was as if they went completely out of their way to ensure this was an amazing vacation.

3. a few cons: there is no microwave. i know this is trivial, but when you bring home the amazing food from these incredible new york restaurants, you want to look forward to warm leftovers. unfortunately, they do not have a microwave on the premises, but the staff tried to give me ideas of places that may have a public microwave nearby to use, and i appreciate that so very much. so if you go out to eat, make sure you remember that you probably can't warm up your food for a later time. another draw back is there is no shuttle between the warwick and the airports. it's not a big deal, but be mindful when you check out, to give yourself extra time (and extra budget) to secure transportation to the airport.

overall, this was an amazing visit at an equally amazing hotel. everything was just absolutely perfect, and i am certain i will use this hotel again on all of our visits to new york. my new york home away from home.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5,4/29/25 12:37,Thank you again for staying with us.

however, when we arrived on thursday, we were assigned a room in the back corner of the building, which has no view or natural sunlight. i should have requested something different in advance, as the lack of daylight can be a bit disorienting—especially with a baby in tow. we used the bathtub and shower without any issues, including the shower gel and shampoo provided. however, on friday, i turned on the water, stepped into the tub, and slipped—hard. the surface was much more slippery than usual, and it felt unexpectedly hazardous. i ended up having to put a towel down in the tub just to avoid slipping again. the hotel itself is clean, but it’s definitely an older building. the anti-slip finish must’ve been worn down.

afterwards, i called the manager to report what happened. his response was, “it doesn’t happen a lot,” which honestly made me feel worse. if it has happened before—even infrequently—why not take preventative measures in the first place? he did send someone up later with a bathtub mat. i’m just really grateful i didn’t hit my head.

Hyatt Grand Central New York,6/3/25 14:41,58675,"if i could rate the service a zero, i would. the service was sub par, to say the least. staff spoke very monotone while dealing with us, and when we had questions, gave rude facial expressions as if it was a dumb thing to ask (it was a nice twinge of annoyance answering, instead of the monotone voice they had previously used). we had asked for two courtesy bottles of water - one for my husband and one for myself. this is the first and only hotel that i have ever experienced charging money for water. the second question we had asked if the cost of checking a bag ($4, also the first time we had paid to simply check a bag) was the same for all bag sizes, and the staff rudely answered back.

the location is the only redeeming quality. grand central station has so many beautiful shops and great food.

the rooms are spacious, but trash was left in the hallway by our door and the trash bins were filled with ordered or leftover foods. it was practically overflowing in the hallway.

we will not be back to this hyatt. it’s hands down the worst one we’ve been to. you pay money to have a convenient location and get treated like less than by the staff and forced to pay for services that should be and usually are free. i especially hope this is not the direction that hyatt is trying to head into, where they just charge for services that were otherwise free. while i loved grand central station, there are far better locations.",4.0,3.0,1.0,1,,,Hyatt,0.067,0.802,0.131,0.9708

Hyatt Grand Central New York,5/30/25 12:08,62815,"we were very unhappy with our stay, and i would recommend that people consider staying at hotels elsewhere.

on the first day, after we checked in, we went up to our room and found that it had a slight odor. the odor kept growing within the next 2 hours, until the room smelled entirely of urine. we traced it to the ac vent, which was blasting out urine-smelling air reminiscent of one of the worse subway entrances in manhattan (maybe it makes for a authentic midtown new york vibe; who knows?).

we went down to the front desk to ask for a room change. in the second room, our experience was no better. the bed had a stain in the form of a brown streak on it; the shower towels were stained; and the shower still had hairs on it presumably from whomever stayed there before. it also had free pokemon cards in the couch cushions, although i imagine this was a cleaning oversight rather than a nice complementary benefit. we finally decided to ask for another room change after not being able to sleep due to random knocking noises coming from the bathroom. we ended up having to switch to a third room at 2am.

lastly, after paying likely $200 or so per night, the hotel will help you forget that you did that by pretending instead to be a budget hotel and attempting to charge you $4 per item for storage on the day of checking out because you dared to ask them to put your bags in a room for a couple of hours after spending over a $1000 to stay there. as a silver lining, being nickel and dimed right at the end of our time here helped us forget about all the other stressful parts of checking out.

i thought that this hyatt, in general, had a very thoughtful atmosphere. it encouraged us to think deeply about other places to stay the next time we're here, and i'd encourage others to do so as well! (the location is pretty good though!)",5.0,1.0,2.0,1,6/1/25 19:25,"Dear Efe Akinci,

Hyatt Grand Central New York,5/25/25 0:29,23900,"absolutely phenomenal experience at the grand hyatt new york at grand central — truly an iconic gem in the heart of manhattan!

from the moment i stepped in, i was enveloped in timeless elegance and energy that mirrors the very soul of new york city. what sets this hotel apart, beyond its impeccable service and stunning interiors, is its unbeatable location. it’s not just near grand central station — it feels like a seamless extension of it. that kind of access isn’t just convenient, it’s integral to the rhythm of real new york living. trains, subways, taxis — everything pulses right at your doorstep. the convenience made my entire stay feel dynamic, efficient, and effortlessly luxurious.

the rooms? spacious, spotless, and stylishly modern with just the right touch of classic nyc sophistication. every detail, from the plush bedding to the skyline views, felt intentionally designed to elevate your stay.

staff went above and beyond — genuinely warm, attentive, and quick to respond to any request. whether it was a late-night food recommendation or help navigating the city, their hospitality never missed a beat.

staying here wasn’t just a visit — it was an experience. it made me feel like a real new yorker, fully immersed in the city’s pulse, and i can’t imagine coming back to the city without staying here again. a glowing five stars — if i could give it more, i would.

the grand hyatt new york at grand central boasts a rich architectural history. originally opened in 1919 as the commodore hotel, it was designed by the esteemed architectural firm warren & wetmore, who also co-designed the adjacent grand central terminal. in the late 1970s, real estate developer donald trump, in partnership with hyatt hotels, undertook a significant renovation of the property. this transformation, completed in 1980, was led by the architectural firm gruzen & partners, with architect der scutt serving as a design consultant. scutt later gained prominence for designing trump tower. the renovation introduced a sleek glass façade, modernizing the hotel’s appearance while maintaining its iconic status in the cityscape. ￼",5.0,5.0,5.0,5,,,Hyatt,0.006,0.843,0.15,0.9941
Hyatt Grand Central New York,5/24/25 19:53,91670,"very disappointing experience

our stay was quite disappointing from the start. we arrived at 11 am and requested an early check-in. the receptionist mentioned that a room would most likely be available soon and that we would receive a call. however, we never heard back until 4 pm, which was frustrating.

when we finally checked in at 4 pm and asked for a bellboy, we were told he wasn't available and that we would need to carry our own luggage—even though we were holding tea and coffee cups. only after we expressed our discomfort did a staff member offer to help us up to the elevator.

once in the room, we found there was no kettle, tea, coffee, or even drinking water provided. the bathroom had just one bar of soap—no body wash or separate body soap—so we had to call and request basic amenities.

to top it all off, when checking out, we asked if they could store our luggage for a few hours and were told it would cost us$4 per bag. this level of service was far below expectations and not something i would recommend.",5.0,1.0,1.0,1,,,Hyatt,0.074,0.892,0.035,-0.8354

the bathroom smelled awful (like dirty towels), the chairs were stained, and the ice bucket was filthy. housekeeping skipped our room one day despite our request. basic toiletries were missing, tiny shampoo/conditioner (not same brand as website shows), not restocked, no q-tips, no blow dryer, no extra toilet paper. we got no response when we asked for these.

room phone didn’t work, and no one fixed it. no free bottled water (unlike other hyatts), and the market water was overpriced. bleach smell was overpowering, trying to mask the lack of real cleanliness. tv had no streaming apps. a/c wouldn’t go below 65. hallway noise and barking dogs were constant.

breakfast? $45 per person with fruit flies and a rushed vibe toward the end of service. we were charged to store luggage after checkout, and our confirmed room was downgraded at check-in. no recognition of hyatt explorist status.

Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel,6/2/25 12:06,97518,"i was disappointed with my recent stay at the sheraton in times square. upon checking into my first room, i immediately noticed it had not been properly cleaned. the bedding was stained, the countertops were dirty, and the bathroom had hair throughout—including on the ceiling—which was especially unsettling.

after reporting the issue, i was moved to a second room, but unfortunately encountered similar problems. the bedding was once again stained, and the door to the bathroom was visibly dirty.

while i appreciated the staff’s willingness to relocate me, the overall lack of cleanliness in both rooms left me feeling uncomfortable and dissatisfied. for a hotel in such a prime location and at this price point, i expected much higher standards of cleanliness and upkeep.

Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel,5/31/25 20:31,78781,"i am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with my recent stay at the sheraton. unfortunately, this experience fell far below the standard i expected from a hotel of your brand’s reputation.

first and foremost, the customer service was extremely disappointing. staff at the front desk and around the hotel seemed disengaged and unhelpful, creating an unwelcoming atmosphere throughout my stay. it was clear that many employees were either unhappy or indifferent to guest experiences.

in addition, the facilities were severely lacking. the wifi was not working. the elevator was out of order during my visit, causing unnecessary inconvenience—especially for someone staying for work and needing to move around efficiently. to make matters worse, the television in my room did not work at all. while i appreciate the effort of the it staff member who tried his best to resolve the issue, it was still an unacceptable inconvenience.

the only positive note of my stay was the housekeeper, who was kind, professional, and clearly took pride in her work. her demeanor stood out in an otherwise unpleasant environment.

overall, this experience was frustrating and unprofessional. i did not feel like a valued guest, and i did not appreciate any of the accommodations or services that were supposed to make my work trip more comfortable. i sincerely hope that management will address these issues seriously so future guests don’t encounter the same problems.",4.0,2.0,1.0,2,6/1/25 6:10,"Dear Gemelie,

Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel,5/25/25 4:02,61370,"the good, the bad, & the ugly — a classic clint eastwood experience at sheraton times square

the good:
our stay at the sheraton times square came with standout service from several exceptional staff members. ahmed welcomed us warmly at check-in and set a great tone. kendra, the concierge, was outstanding—going above and beyond to provide helpful information and personalized service. jimmy at the bell desk was equally impressive—friendly, efficient, and accommodating.

the elevator system is one of the most efficient i’ve seen in a high-rise hotel—smart panel controls that keep things moving smoothly even during busy hours.

we did our homework before booking, and this sheraton proved to be one of the best values in times square. its central location, pricing, and amenities clearly appeal to travelers, as evidenced by the consistent lines at both the front desk and concierge.

our room was clean, comfortable, and provided the rest we needed.

the bad:
the long lines at registration were a recurring issue—almost every time we passed by, guests were waiting. while it speaks to the hotel’s popularity, it does affect convenience.

construction at the primary entrance was a bit of an inconvenience, but not a deal-breaker.

housekeeping responded quickly when we reported an unpleasant odor and visible mold on the shower liner, but it should have been addressed proactively before check-in.

the ugly:
unfortunately, our experience with one staff member, samuel, was repeatedly negative. over a short two-night stay, we witnessed multiple incidents where he was aggressive, dismissive, and outright rude to both guests and his colleagues. his behavior during a simple inquiry about water was unnecessarily hostile, and i observed him shouting at other guests and staff on multiple occasions. in my opinion, samuel is not suited for a customer-facing role, and his conduct was a sharp contrast to the otherwise professional staff.

overall:
despite a few bumps, our stay was enjoyable and well worth the price. most of the staff were excellent, and the location can’t be beat. if management addresses the front desk efficiency and takes a serious look at how guests are treated across the board, this sheraton could easily earn five stars.",5.0,4.0,4.0,4,,,Marriott,0.088,0.796,0.116,0.6855

Hilton New York Times Square,5/16/25 18:05,95274,"my stay at the hilton new york times square was, overall, a deeply disappointing experience. from the moment i reached out to the hotel, it felt like every interaction was designed to squeeze more money out of me. i emailed to request an early check-in, only to receive a curt response informing me it would cost an extra $100. this set the tone for what felt like a relentless push to upsell at every turn.

fortunately, at check-in, someone recognized my diamond status, and the early check-in was made complimentary, which was a small relief. george at the front desk was a bright spot—he provided the wi-fi password for diamond members, handed me two water bottles, and informed me about my $18 credit. however, the credit didn’t go far, as the options to use it were limited and overpriced.

to make matters worse, they placed me on a low floor, even though i later learned other rooms were available. i didn’t expect an upgrade—room upgrades in the u.s. seem to be a thing of the past—but it felt like a deliberate choice to stick me in a less desirable room. the room itself was just okay, but noticeably dusty, which added to the overall sense of neglect.

the issues continued with housekeeping. at 9 a.m., they knocked on my door for no apparent reason, claiming they needed to ""check on the room."" why? it was intrusive and unnecessary. i requested a noon checkout, but they still knocked at 11 a.m., completely disregarding my request. this lack of attention to basic guest preferences was frustrating.

the hotel’s location in times square is prime, but it’s tucked away in an annoying alleyway, making it a hassle to get in and out of the property. it’s clear they rely on this optimal location to drive revenue without prioritizing guest experience. as a hilton loyalist, i felt like just another number, not a valued customer. there’s zero effort to make guests feel cared for—it’s all about maximizing profit.

the on-site long acre market was another low point. the sandwiches were overpriced and overheated, and the staff was outright rude when i asked for recommendations. a large coffee cost an absurd $12. i quickly decided to skip the hotel’s high rise buffet entirely and eat outside, which was a much better choice.

ultimately, i wouldn’t recommend the hilton new york times square to anyone. the combination of poor customer service, constant upcharges, subpar room assignment, and a general disregard for guest comfort makes this a place to avoid, despite its central location.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1,5/16/25 22:37,"George, thank you for providing detailed insights on your recent visit.

Hilton New York Times Square,5/11/25 10:33,81385,"i had a bit higher expectations for this hilton considering the price and location of the hotel. we arrived and couldn’t do early check in (fine i understand) and waited over an hour. finally got a call our room was ready so i went to the front desk to get checked in. i wanted to make sure we were getting the room i booked and asked to confirm. the front desk lady said they “upgraded” us to a 2 queen bed on the 42nd floor. i didn’t want 2 queen beds. if i did, i would’ve booked that option. i had booked a 1 king bed corner suite with sofa bed. she seemed annoyed i wanted the room i booked specifically and said we’d have to wait again and she’d come to us when it was ready. cool. waited another 20-30min. finally she comes over hands us the key cards and we went about our day…
i had booked the breakfast buffet to be included in our stay out of convenience. next morning we go to get breakfast it’s confusing the guy seating us tried to help but said our room didn’t include breakfast so alas i am back at the front desk and was told that it was a mistake it’s included and was provided the breakfast vouchers. the lady who helped that morning was kind so i appreciated that. i wish the lady who checked us in the day before was kinder and more helpful instead of giving me a passive aggressive attitude and rushing us.
the rest of the stay was uneventful, the main lobby is nice but it’s a bummer they don’t upgrade the rooms. the beds were eh and overall vibe felt super outdated. for the price, i just had higher expectations. the food market in the lobby is also a total rip off as to be expected, wayyyyy overpriced.
i only really liked the convenience of the location of the hotel. we were at least able to walk to most places we wanted to visit. my husband and son went down for breakfast our last morning there and he felt rushed, didn’t get to enjoy their meal.

hotel is conveniently located steps from time square with a “secret entrance”. you will miss it if you blink. you a take an elevator to the very busy and chaotic lobby/bar/restaurant. our room wasn’t ready when we arrived so we were able to stow our luggage at no charge. overall, the staff we encountered were professional and cordial.

the room we were given had an amazing view. however, the room had a stuffy musty smell probably from the very old and worn carpet. the decor seemed pretty “new” but very worn from the 100s if not thousands of guests that have stayed in it. there were cracks in the wall paper on the walls and also on the ceiling. the heavy drapery also had the smell of many many guests.

on the ground floor there is an entrance on two sides, by taking one of the two lifts you will reach the hall with a bar area, restaurant, breakfast room and a small internal market

quick and convenient check-in, we had the room on the 43rd floor with a magnificent view of the empire (the view was worth the room)
the room is generously sized compared to the manhattan average, as other reviews report, the furnishings appear dated, little time is spent in the room and it does not affect my rating, i would have appreciated the classic slippers and a toothbrush kit, in italian 4-star hotels it is a standard that is also found in lower categories, on the contrary the hall appears modern and with large spaces

in my opinion the breakfast was fantastic, wide choice of sweet and savory

as amex platinum holders, we received welcome kits with water and a daily credit of $12 each per day that we could spend in the internal market (we used them to purchase water and some snacks)

i had booked a room on a high floor, but when i asked them why they weren't on a high floor because they were worried about the noise, they kept making excuses, saying they wouldn't know if it was on a high floor until they entered the reservation system.

i saw many other people saying that the service was bad so i was convinced.
the only good thing is the location.

gold members receive $18 per person per day, which cannot be carried over to the next day and must be spent before checkout. well, it seems that i often use it for breakfast.

breakfast is served as a buffet (approximately $60 including tax) or continental ($40) on the lobby floor. the difference is whether or not there are hot meals such as sausage and eggs. had the buffet, but not worth the $60. there is a deli in front of the restaurant, so for a breakfast bundle of $18 (plus a service fee of about $3, so it's not worth the total), you can get a bagel, a piece of fruit such as a banana, and coffee or orange juice. there are various other sweets, so please make your own combinations such as croissants and yogurt. don't forget to charge your room rate.

we are diamond members and received a voucher for $36. but because everything took so long and the room wasn't available, we got an additional voucher for $36, making a total of two vouchers for $36. we redeemed both vouchers in the shop next door. however, after checkout i was charged approximately $36, so a voucher was not charged.
i have been in contact with hilton since january and the money has still not been returned, the response from hilton times square is that the money has been returned, which is not the case. no one has responded to my emails for 3 weeks!

i booked breakfast during the reservation – paid for it, but didn’t receive it. apparently, breakfast is only included if you book directly through hilton. the room wasn’t even what i had booked at first.

the front desk told me that when you book through third-party platforms, there is no room guarantee and breakfast is not available either. only direct bookings avoid this. i showed the booking confirmation and proof of payment.

martina and the manager couldn’t care less – they said i should take it up with whoever i booked through, because they “don’t feel like dealing with it.” utterly unacceptable and completely unfriendly customer service.

i spoke with lastminute.com via chat right away – they immediately said they would contact hilton. i even showed the chat to the front desk, but they just stood there like wax figures from madame tussauds. that evening i followed up again, and the answer was: “we haven’t received any email.” sure…

keep your breakfast – i paid for. absolutely worthless organization. sell the place to someone who actually understands customer service, or better yet, hire an ai concierge. in my opinion, this is a hopeless organization with clueless management.

i thought hilton stood for class and quality. clearly, i was wrong – far from it!

and on top, they sign me up for their hilton membership without asking, just so i’ll always get a cheaper rate they advertise, if i book directly instead of through a third party. what a cheap and pathetic way to lure in customers. absolute bottom-tier behavior",2.0,2.0,1.0,1,5/1/25 14:01,"Peter, thank you for sharing your thoughts.

"InterContinental New York Times Square, an IHG Hotel",6/1/25 14:22,16022,"before i share my feedback on my stay at the intercontinental hotel, it’s important to mention it was my birthday week that i decided to spend in new york and at the same time it was my very first visit to new york ever. :)

the rating of my review is based on two main factors:
1.great location - resound the corner from times square, as opposed to being on the heart times square which is constantly crowded.
2.hotel team, to mention those i have had the pleasure of receiving the service from:
-rose - converge desk for ambassadors members, looked after me from the start with upgrades and other perks.
-nick - at the stinger bar/restaurant - very welcoming and accommodating various requests at my first dinner with my family at the hotel
-eddie (spaghetti) - at the stinger - made me feel very special going the extra mile to create the personalized dining experience and especially on my birthday evening.
-matthew (mateusz) - f&b manager 1 -very professional ensuring i was looked after at all times
-mr priya - f&b manager 2 - he made the extra effort to collect for me bottle caps when i mentioned that i’m collecting them wherever i travel to help my nephew grow his bottle caps collection of 20k+
-elaz, roger, liton - at breakfast - amazing team, very efficient in the service they provided and genuinely pleasant and nice nich made me feel very welcome every day at breakfast time.
-ahmed - at front desk - very efficient with friendly approach at check out.

the bottom line is no matter where we are staying, the way we feel is always an outcome of our interaction with other human beings - in this instance the hotel team, and their individual approach to the service their provide. rule number one to received great service is to walk into the place with a positive and friendly attitude.

thank you. :)",5.0,3.0,5.0,5,6/2/25 16:18,"Agnieszka, the team at InterContinental New York Times Square is truly delighted you chose to celebrate your birthday week and first New York visit with us.

"InterContinental New York Times Square, an IHG Hotel",5/31/25 12:54,55635,"the location is good. but the location is the only thing that is good.

i expected a times square view, but they gave me a room with a view of the back alley of the parking lot.
make sure to bring a shower filter. when i turned on the shower once, the white filter immediately turned brown. when i complained about the charge for champagne that i didn't drink when i checked out, they said that if you put something in the minibar fridge, it can be automatically charged. it was good that they fixed it quickly, but i almost got ripped off if i checked out without looking at it properly (there are actually reviews like that, so be careful)

i ate the breakfast buffet, and during the 30 minutes i ate, they asked me, ""should i clean up after you're done?"" at least 5 times. it felt like they were urging me to eat quickly and leave, so i didn't like it. and they didn't let us sit in the seat we wanted to sit in for no reason, and after a while, they made white guests sit there.
the staff also fought loudly with each other while eating breakfast.

and when i told them that they were out of apples and asked them to bring them, they told me to wait 2 minutes and that they would bring them from the basement, but in reality, it took about 20 minutes and they brought plums instead of apples. of course, there was no notification that they had brought them, and we had to check for ourselves that the plums were placed in the food corner.",5.0,1.0,1.0,1,,,IHG,0.061,0.849,0.09,0.8781

another great stay at the intercontinental times square. my wife and i checked out this morning and the news is the hotel is still the same.....great. again, it's the people.
there was a warm welcome back at the ambassador desk with chyna and a sad (but very efficient) check out with rose. we missed paul in the bar this year due to vacation but leo and lila and the always fun jorge made it a great way to start and finish the evening. special mention to george.
it was great again to see and be so well taken care of at breakfast by neil, samira, hakeem and another leo with great help from liton. breakfast is always very busy but it would be a rugby match without these five professional people and others.
before i finish this next bit, it is worth mentioning that this hotel is in nyc which is not exactly world renowned for friendly people, but everyone is so helpful, friendly and professional at the intercontinental times square. how often is it that one does not use the bell team but gets to know them because of their great attitude and engaging personalities. thanks benny and abu.
i am not sure what the very capable gm, jeff krauthamer (see below) puts in the staff morning coffee but whatever it is i wish every gm did it. this hotel has nice rooms, is really well located, really well staffed and really well lead. might be a little more money but worth every dime.

july 24, 2024
my wife and i just finished a truly wonderful 5 nights at the intercontinental times square in new york city. over the years we have stayed at many hotels in nyc but have now definitely found our new home. the location at 44th and 8th avenue is very handy to everything and the subway entrance is 20’ from the front door. there are loads of things going on midtown but there is very easy access to all of manhattan and the other boroughs. there is a very well kitted out gym with towels and cleaning supplies that we used every day.
the location is great but it is the staff at all levels that makes the hotel wonderful. from the first minute the welcome mat is out with johan and the door and bell crew who are always so cheerful and helpful. check in at the front desk with joseph and help throughout our stay at the ambassador desk with chyna (sp?) and the ever patient, kind and professional, rose, was a snap. housekeeping was very accommodating and the breakfast team of neil, hakeem and samira kept things running smoothly including my quad expresso cappuccinos each morning. throw in paul at the bar and from morning till night you are helped by great people.
the intercontinental times square is not cheap but on nyc standards it is a bargain. the property in general is very nice but this hotel is the final irrefutable proof that bricks and mortar does not a great hotel make. it is the people, all of whom are a tribute to the gm jeff krauthamer (whom we met while chatting with the bell team) who runs a tight and professional ship.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5,7/27/24 20:53,"Derek,

Hotel Indigo Lower East Side New York by IHG,5/17/25 22:10,96955,"first and foremost, yes… i should’ve realized there was a night club in this hotel. caught it too late when we checked in, we told them we had a baby and wanted to be somewhere quiet. they told us they had gotten us a quiet room… friday night, from midnight til 4am there was insanely loud music playing. bass so strong the room was vibrating, nothing i could do to mitigate the noise. it was one of the worst experiences i’ve ever had in a hotel.

i think it’s fair to assume that when you pay for a hotel room, you are being provided a quiet place to sleep, at minimum. clearly this place cares more about the night club than the comfort of their guests at night. it’s new york, it’s a loud city but this was insanity.

Hotel Indigo Lower East Side New York by IHG,5/9/25 11:33,16029,"**ideal location with friendly staff, but beware of hidden fees**

nestled in the vibrant lower east side, this hotel boasts a perfect location for those looking to explore both the lower east side and brooklyn effortlessly. the proximity to a myriad of famous restaurants, vintage shops, and easy access to iconic neighborhoods like chinatown and soho make it a prime spot for urban adventurers.

the staff at this hotel truly shine with their exceptional friendliness and eagerness to assist, adding a welcoming touch to the overall stay. their hospitality undoubtedly enhances the guest experience and sets a positive tone for the visit.

while the view from the hotel is commendable, offering glimpses of the bustling cityscape, it falls slightly short of perfection considering the price point. however, the convenience of the location and the nearby attractions somewhat compensate for this minor drawback.

one aspect that left a bitter taste in my mouth was the hidden amenity fee, which was mandatory and deducted from the deposit. this unexpected charge, albeit disclosed in the fine print, can catch guests off guard and detract from the overall experience. it's advisable to be aware of this fee beforehand to avoid any unwelcome surprises during check-out.

in conclusion, this hotel is a solid choice for those seeking a convenient base to explore the lower east side and brooklyn. with its perfect location, friendly staff, and proximity to various dining and shopping destinations, it offers a promising stay. just be mindful of the hidden amenity fee to ensure a smoother and more transparent booking process.",5.0,4.0,4.0,4,5/9/25 15:45,"We're glad to hear that you appreciated our ideal location and friendly staff.

Hotel Indigo Lower East Side New York by IHG,4/26/25 13:44,50081,"i am appalled by the blatant prejudice we experienced with the sales team at this hotel. this interaction occurred while attempting to plan a tour of property and negotiate a room block for an upcoming reception. as an interracial queer couple, we were made to feel unwelcome and unwanted, being explicitly told ""maybe this hotel is not right for you.""

we had planned to send 150+ guest to this hotel, with many of our guests coming from europe, africa, australia as well as within the us. to think that they could be subjected to such abhorrent treatment is unacceptable.

while senior management offered a hollow apology for the 'misunderstanding,' the employee (rhys) responsible for this mistreatment faces no consequences, and we've received no offer of amends for our deeply negative experience.

from the moment we stepped into the lee quiñones graffiti-adorned lobby, hotel indigo lower east side radiated nyc cool with a touch of boutique charm. it wasn't just the location (walking distance to trendy hotspots and historic gems) or the stunning manhattan views from our room; it was the soul of the place that truly captivated us.

**design that dazzles:** our room was an urban haven – hardwood floors, plush linens, and rainfall showers were just the beginning. local art adorned the walls, and the keurig coffee maker was a delightful surprise. but the crown jewel? the rooftop pool overlooking the city skyline – sunrise swims and sunset cocktails became instant rituals.

**service with a smile (and citi bike passes):** the staff were the epitome of nyc hospitality – friendly, informative, and always willing to go the extra mile. the complimentary amenity fee included everything from citi bike passes (exploring the city on two wheels was a blast!) to a $20 minibar credit. talk about value! kenny and others made sure we were more than welcomed and made us feel special from the first minute until our check out.

** room: **
kenny helped us get a room on 23rd floor and it was more than we could ask for. the bathroom had a heated floor and shower with a view of new york city skyline (the edge and neighborhood was visible when you took shower). room size was amazing for new york and tall windows had about 250 degrees view of the new york city. minimalistic furniture made it all more so elegant.

**neighborhood nirvana:** hotel indigo isn't just a hotel; it's a gateway to the vibrant lower east side. we were steps away from trendy cafes, buzzing nightlife, and cool street art. the hotel even offered curated neighborhood guides, leading us to hidden gems like a vintage clothing store and a rooftop bar with killer views.

**foodie nirvana:** the onsite restaurant, mr. purple, was a culinary highlight. from the melt-in-your-mouth avocado toast at breakfast to the creative small plates for dinner, each dish was a delicious ode to the neighborhood's multicultural influence.

**leaving a piece of our hearts:** checking out was bittersweet. hotel indigo wasn't just a place to stay; it was an experience. we left feeling like we'd discovered a secret corner of nyc and made new friends in the staff. this is more than a 5-star hotel; it's a lower east side love letter, and we can't wait to write our next chapter at hotel indigo.

**p.s.** don't miss the rooftop pool at sunset; it's pure magic!

Hotel Indigo Lower East Side New York by IHG,3/25/25 23:16,55516,"honestly one of the largest rooms you’ll get in nyc. staff are mostly fun and friendly. if you stay thu-sun the club is on and you’ll be grilled by security every time you want to go up to your room. these guys really need to sort their billing out. we got locked out of room at 12.30 midnight because they couldn’t process a payment we didn’t know was due. took an hour to sort out. then everything was cool but they slapped another usd400 on our card without asking or telling us. apparently for “incidentals”. thats fine - just inform your guest before you commandeer their bank card at your will without being clear or transparent. a lot of billing / charge issues - be super wary of these guys, they are borderline dishonest. otherwise a beautiful 10 day stay.
edit - 5 days after checkout we are still waiting for over $800 to be returned to us, more unexplained charges on our card, including a “miscellaneous” $70 charge. if you do stay here be very very clear with these people what they are allowed to charge to card, and get it in writing. probably lock your card or empty the funds, because these guys are dodgy at worst, incompetent at best. super not impressed. ihg can get lost. not staying in your hotels again. 😡",5.0,3.0,1.0,3,3/21/25 15:35,"Hi Joseph,

Hotel Indigo Lower East Side New York by IHG,3/25/25 11:41,55168,"visiting nyc, hotel indigo in lower east side is the spot to stay. you’re right in the middle of everything on the island of nyc. north for ts or south for financial district, soho, little italy.
around the corner from here is one of the best saunas in nyc (russian and turkish bath house).

katz deli (one of the most famous sub spots in nyc) is right next to the hotel, open 24hrs on weekends!

note: if your room is near the 15th floor (which is the floor of the rooftop bar/night club. it is extremely noisy and expect to here music until 4am. we stay on the 16th floor right above the club, beautiful views but the noise can be hard to sleep through if you’re not apart of the party.

Hotel Indigo Lower East Side New York by IHG,3/22/25 0:46,72097,"i’ve been to nyc 8 times, and this was hands down my worst hotel experience. everything was fine until and friday night when the nightclub—actually two clubs on the 14th and 15th floors of the same building as the hotel—started operating. the noise was unbearable, making it impossible to sleep. the front desk staff kept saying there was nothing they could do about it, which was frustrating.
after 4 calls in the middle of the night and even going down to reception in person, they finally agreed to switch our room. but here’s the catch: we had to pack up all our stuff at 1 a.m. and move ourselves to the new room. we begged them to let us sleep and pack the next day, but they refused. to top it off, no one from the hotel offered to help us with the move—not a single staff member lifted a finger.
this was a nightmare. i’ve never dealt with anything like this in nyc before. definitely not recommending this place to anyone. horrible experience.",4.0,2.0,1.0,1,3/23/25 20:50,"Hi Alan,

New York Marriott Marquis,5/31/25 11:49,42840,"my recent stay at the marriott marquis times square was one of the most stressful and poorly handled hotel experiences i’ve ever had.

upon check-in, after a long day of delayed flights…i was told that marriott had not received payment from my travel company, even though that payment had been submitted on april 1st. my travel provider confirmed that the card authorization had been sent well in advance, but marriott staff, particularly a manager named grace, insisted they had nothing on file. rather than working with me to sort things out, grace was cold, dismissive, and completely unhelpful. there was no empathy, no flexibility, and no effort to problem-solve, only condescension and an ultimatum that if they didn’t receive payment by a certain time, i would lose my room.

because it was 9:30 pm and my travel provider was only available for emergencies after-hours, there was no easy way to resolve it immediately. i was left with no option but to put a night on my personal card just to avoid being stranded after a full day of travel.

then came the checkout issue. although a hold had been placed on my personal credit card, nothing on my checkout itinerary reflected that charge. i had no documentation…no proof that it had even been processed….and staff initially said they couldn’t provide anything to show that amount or authorization. it took over 30 minutes of standing at the desk before someone finally generated a code and a note with the amount that would eventually be credited.

all of this could have been avoided with better communication, basic hospitality, and a willingness to help. instead, i was met with resistance and indifference at every step. at a property as prominent as the marriott marquis, i expected far better.

i won’t be returning to this hotel, and i’ll be advising my company to reconsider using it for business travel. being treated like a burden after doing nothing wrong is simply unacceptable.",,,1.0,1,,,Marriott,0.102,0.775,0.123,0.8808

the lighting in the room was dismal. even when every light was on, things felt very dark at night...so if you're traveling with two people...you might want to bring a make up mirror.
there are also only two elevators that serve not only the hotel guests, but also are used by staff members cleaning, bringing luggage to the rooms, and perform basic maintenance. to be clear, every employee we encountered was very kind about ""waiting for the next elevator"", but there was never a time...day or night...when we jumped right on to the elevator...there was always a wait.
our room was well cleaned, but the second night we were there, we returned after 11 pm to find that the maid had opened our windows, and did not close them again upon departing! the room was freezing!
and although the staff was friendly, there was one grumpy employee who i encountered on several occasions who seemed bothered when i asked for bottled water, or any other simple request. then, on our last evening, i politely asked if i could have two bottles of water on the way up to the room. she did not respond. thinking she hadn't hear me, i very politely asked again. she rudely said, ""i heard you, we're out."" wow.

housekeeping was amazing at checking in and getting things done while we were out. we did have one late morning and they quite literally caught us in a mid-morning cuddle but i won't blame them for that. we could have easily popped on the do-not-disturb sign and they were just trying to do their jobs.

our first day, after traveling for 6 hours, we ordered room service that took an hour and a half to arrive and was missing a side dish. not ideal but it was also okay.

we had a view of time square and once we got a hang of the elevators, actually loved it. will definitely stay again!",5.0,5.0,4.0,5,,,Marriott,0.039,0.833,0.127,0.9256

"Marriott Vacation Club, New York City",12/23/24 0:31,56639,"i can’t believe i’m taking the time to write this review on a vacation, but i am shaking because i am so upset with how we have been treated the last three nights here. our family comes to new york at least once a year and we stay in a lot of different hotels for different experiences and locations. we always stay at marriott’s and i recently became a vacation club owner. we have stayed at a lot of different properties in the united states and a few internationally and they have all been wonderful. the new york city pulse treated me like i was a piece of trash off the street. i have actually been in tears twice since coming here. the way the staff has lied to me and spoken to me, you would think i was a criminal. i am incredibly uncomfortable here and as i sit here on my last evening writing this review i hope i can spare anyone else from the terrible experience here. there are thousands of hotels in new york city and if you’re a marriott girl like me… you have your choice of different marriotts … please stay away from this one. they really need to train their staff on how to properly speak to paying customers. my last interaction was with a girl named bethany, who would not let me speak, kept speaking over me, told me that the hotel was at full capacity, and she could not accommodate any sort of late check out, while i was still speaking she hung up on me. i then had to call back and asked to speak to her colleague who was magically able to extend my check out for an hour or two. funny enough, i had to tell her that they weren’t at full capacity because i went on my marriott bonvoy account and was able to reserve three different rooms. this is just one example… i will admit there was some of the staff that was very nice here and all of the cleaning people were very, very sweet but the front desk people here desperately needs some training on how to talk to people. i probably stay in at least 10 different hotels a year and i have never been spoken to like this, and i have certainly never ended up in tears… you need to get your act together nyc pulse. you are truly making me regret my decision on becoming a marriot vacation club owner. for reference, i am also platinum elite marriott bonvoy. my son is 8 years old and he was even shocked at this interaction because even at eight years old, he is smart enough to know that is not how you treat people.

i am now editing this because i am reading some of the other one star reviews and i cannot believe how many complaints there are about the rude front desk staff. i also had a bad interaction with carter. very rude and a lot of huffing and puffing for even asking him a simple question. i thought i was just in a really bad room and had drunk people next-door to me, but i am now finding out that the walls are just really paper thin… there were very late night guest next to me, but the doors were so close together that it woke me up because i thought someone was breaking into my room and it was incredibly scary but now i’m understanding that they give earplugs because maybe everybody else has this experience also. wow, i really cannot believe how bad this hotel is… please please please do your research and book somewhere else because there are just so many excellent choices in new york city… i could rattle off 10 other hotels i’ve stayed at that have been absolutely amazing and they are all marriot brand.",5.0,2.0,1.0,1,,,Marriott,0.089,0.803,0.108,0.9347
